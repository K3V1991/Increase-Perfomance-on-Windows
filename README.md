## Keep Your PC Cool to Prevent Thermal Throttling:
> One of the biggest Reasons for Frame Drops and Lags in Games is Overheating. <br />
The biggest Causes of excess Heating in PCs is a build-up of Dust on the Fans and other Components inside your Case.

## Restarting
> It might be obvious, but it's not the first Thing that usually comes to Mind. <br />
> When the Device restarts, the computer usually terminates the Applications and Processes. <br />
> The Data loaded into Memory gets cleared, which helps to resolve everyday Performance and Stability Issues.

## Close Background Processes
> If you have hardware-hungry Programs open in the Background, they may prevent your PC from using its full Potential in games‚Äîparticularly if you have a lower-end PC with limited Resources.
<hr>
<br />

<h1 align="center">Applications:</h1>
